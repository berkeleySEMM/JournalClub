# JournalClub
A repose for the proceedings of our weekly journal club.

## What is Journal Club?

- We have discussions about research work in SEMM.
- Each week, someone presents a journal paper they've read, a tool they've developed, some data they've recently acquired, or anything else they've been looking into.

## What's the point of Journal Club?

- Keep up with literature
- Practice critically reviewing papers and presenting research
- Identify areas of collaboration
- Share knowledge and get a feel for the landscape of your own and adjacent fields
- Eat snacks
